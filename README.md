# Text-Based-Never-Ending-RPG
This was a text based game made using C#.

The game was made in the Microsoft Visual Studio and containted 6 different classes. 

Using the C# language I made a text based game containing several RPG elements. Some of these examples are: Character Classes, Items, Leveling up,
Skill attributes, and a turned based fighting system.

The catch: There is no end to this game. With starting diffuclty of Easy, Medium, and Hard; the player can keep playing hours to hone their skills. 

However, if the player dies in battle, it is game over and all there progress is lost
